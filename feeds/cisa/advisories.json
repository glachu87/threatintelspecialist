      "mitigations": "N/AHitachi Energy recommends the following general mitigation factors: MSM is not intrinsically designed and intended to be directly connected to the internet. Disconnect the device from any internet-facing network. Hitachi Energy suggests adopting user access management and any state-of-the-art antivirus protection engines equipped with the latest signature rules on the computers that have installed and are operating the MSM Client application. As an example, use the operating system (OS) built-in user access management functionality, if supported, to limit the probability of unauthorized access followed by rogue commands via the MSM Client application. Hitachi Energy also recommends following the hardening guidelines published by\"The Center for Internet Security (CIS)\"to protect the host operating system of computers connected with MSM. This measure can help prevent the lateral movement of the attack vector into MSM via these connected devices. Some examples for Windows-based computers are listed below. CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks CIS Microsoft Windows Server Benchmarks Also follow the cybersecurity deployment recommendations as documented in section 3.9 of2GHV045871_2018-P-en-Modular Switchgear Monitoring (MSM) - C. Additionally, Hitachi Energy recommends hardening web browsers in accordance withCIS Critical Security Control 9: Email and Web Browser Protections. Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include ensuring that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.

These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019sCross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goalsfor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. Establish a vulnerability management plan that includes procedures for prioritization and emergency patching.Prioritize patching of known exploited vulnerabilities listed in the KEV catalog.CISA urges organizations to address KEV catalog vulnerabilitiesimmediately.Prioritize patching vulnerabilities in high-risk systems, including public facing systems as they are attractive targets for threat actors.Ensure high-risk systems are identified and prioritized for rapid patching by implementing asset management practices and conducting an asset inventory.Continuously discover and validate internet-facing assets through automated asset management and scanning (e.g., attack surface management tools, vulnerability scanners).Consider using a configuration management database (CMDB) with discovery and vulnerability tools to enrich asset context and support automated prioritization.Form a dedicated team responsible for assessing and implementing emergency patches, this team should include representatives from IT, security, and relevant business units.

Access Control \u2013 Restrict both physical and logical access to authorized personnel only. Application Whitelisting \u2013 Configure whitelisting so that only trusted, pre-approved applications are allowed to run. Block any unauthorized software. Endpoint Protection \u2013 Use antivirus or EDR tools and configure host-based firewalls to block unauthorized access attempts. Logging & Monitoring \u2013 Enable and regularly review system logs to detect suspicious or unauthorized activity. Backup & Recovery \u2013 Maintain secure, tested backups of the PLC and its configurations to minimize downtime in case of an incident.
