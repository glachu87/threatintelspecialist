Users using the affected product versions should take the following actions to mitigate the risk of exploit: Apply AVEVA Edge2023 R2 P01Security Update and migrate old project files. For projects that cannot be migrated (e.g. backups or transient copies), evaluate the risk of potential password leakage from these files and implement stricter read access controls to protect these unsafe files. Require AVEVA Edge users to change their passwords. Important: Edge project migration from older versions to 2023 R2 P01 is one-way due to the change in password hashing algorithms. The following general defensive measures are recommended: Access Control Lists should be applied to all folders where users will save and load project files. Maintain a trusted chain-of-custody on project files during creation, modification, distribution, and use. Apply data-protection at the project level with a strong master password. For configuration step-by-step refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Project Overview > Configuring Additional Project Settings > Options Tab > Data Protection. If passwords are being used as function parameters inside project documents (such as scripts or worksheets), it is recommended to remove those passwords and use project tags instead. For more information on tags refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Tags and the Tag Database > About Tags and the Project Database.
