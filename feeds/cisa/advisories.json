Validate the integrity of the downloaded firmware by confirming its hash value. Access to the controller should remain limited to authorized personnel, and credentials must be protected and updated according to policy to reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications or the installation of tampered firmware Building X - Security Manager Edge Controller (ACC-AP): Currently no fix is planned As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according toSiemens' operational guidelines for industrial securityand following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on theSiemens industrial security webpage For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-420375 inHTMLandCSAF. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov.
