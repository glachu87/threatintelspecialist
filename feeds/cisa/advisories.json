Consult Mitsubishi Electric Iconics Digital SolutionsSupportfor upgrade assistance. Users who remain on affected versions should be aware of this information tampering vulnerability and take any necessary precautions to keep the system safe from potential attackers such as: Configure the PCs with the affected product installed so that only an administrator can log in. PCs with the affected product installed should be configured to block remote logins from untrusted networks and hosts, and from non-administrator users. Block unauthorized access by using a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc., and allow remote login only to administrators when connecting the PCs with the affected product installed to the Internet. Restrict physical access to the PC with the affected product installed and the network to which the PC is connected to prevent unauthorized physical access. Do not click on web links in emails from untrusted sources. Also, do not open attachments in untrusted emails.

This vulnerability enables attackers to escalate privileges and take full control of the device, potentially modifying system settings, disrupting solar energy production, and interfering with safety mechanisms. CVE-2025-7768has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-7768. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Tigo Energy's CCA is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability in the /cgi-bin/mobile_api endpoint when the DEVICE_PING command is called, allowing remote code execution due to improper handling of user input. When used with default credentials, this enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device that could cause potential unauthorized access, service disruption, and data exposure. CVE-2025-7769has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

Tigo Energy's CCA device is vulnerable to insecure session ID generation in their remote API. The session IDs are generated using a predictable method based on the current timestamp, allowing attackers to recreate valid session IDs. When combined with the ability to circumvent session ID requirements for certain commands, this enables unauthorized access to sensitive device functions on connected solar optimization systems.

Recommendations to reduce cyber risk are listed for each of CISA\u2019s findings during this engagement and are ordered starting from the highest to lowest importance for organizations to implement. CISA and USCG also include general practices to strengthen cybersecurity for OT environments that are not tied to specific findings. These mitigations align with theCross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goalsjointly developed by CISA and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). The Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful TTPs. Visit CISA\u2019sCPGs webpagefor more information. Many of these mitigations also align with recommendations made by CGCYBER in their2024 CTIME report. The report provides relevant information and lessons learned about cybersecurity risks gathered through operations similar to this threat hunt engagement, and best practices to mitigate these risks. Please see the2024 CTIME reportfor additional recommendations for critical infrastructure organizations to implement to harden their environments against malicious activity."
