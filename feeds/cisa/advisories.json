The ABB advisory includes a detailed mapping of applicable mitigations for each listed vulnerability. ABB has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk: CVE-2025-53187: This vulnerability has been resolved in product versions 3.08.04-s01 and later. The remaining mitigations are general security measures that apply to all vulnerabilities: All vulnerabilities reported in the scope of this document are exploitable only if the attackers can access the network segment where ASPECT is installed and exposed directly to the Internet. ABB therefore recommends the following guidelines to protect customer networks:ASPECT devices should never be exposed directly to the Internet either via a direct ISP connection or via NAT port forwarding. If remote access to an ASPECT system is a user requirement, the system shall operate behind a firewall. Users accessing ASPECT remotely shall do this using a VPN Gateway allowing access to the network segment where ASPECT is installed and configured.Note: It is crucial that the VPN Gateway and Network are set up in accordance with best industry standards and maintained in terms of security patches for all related components.Authorized users shall change all default credentials during commissioning of an ASPECT system. If credentials have not been changed during commissioning state, ABB advises users to change each changeable credential at the earliest opportunity.Ensure that all ASPECT products are upgraded to the latest firmware version. The latest version of ASPECT firmware can be found on the respective product homepage.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.govin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages. Refer toRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scamsfor more information on avoiding email scams. Refer toAvoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacksfor more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely."

      "executive_summary": "N/APeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber threat actors are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure networks. While these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks. These actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks. This activity partially overlaps with cyber threat actor reporting by the cybersecurity industry\u2014commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807, and GhostEmperor, among others. The authoring agencies are not adopting a particular commercial naming convention and hereafter refer to those responsible for the cyber threat activity more generically as \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors\u201d throughout this advisory. This cluster of cyber threat activity has been observed in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and other areas globally. This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes observations from various government and industry investigations where the APT actors targeted internal enterprise environments, as well as systems and networks that deliver services directly to customers. This CSA details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by these APT actors to facilitate detection and threat hunting, and provides mitigation guidance to reduce the risk from these APT actors and their TTPs. This CSA is being released by the following authoring and co-sealing agencies: United States National Security Agency (NSA) United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD\u2019s ACSC) Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) Czech Republic National Cyber and Information Security Agency (N\u00daKIB) - N\u00e1rodn\u00ed \u00fa\u0159ad pro kybernetickou a informa\u010dn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost Finnish Security and Intelligence Service (SUPO) - Suojelupoliisi Germany Federal Intelligence Service (BND) - Bundesnachrichtendienst Germany Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) - \u00a0 Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz Germany Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) - Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik Italian External Intelligence and Security Agency (AISE) - Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna Italian Internal Intelligence and Security Agency (AISI) - Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Interna Japan National Cybersecurity Office (NCO) - \u56fd\u5bb6\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u7d71\u62ec\u5ba4 Japan National Police Agency (NPA) - \u8b66\u5bdf\u5e81 Netherlands Defence Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) - Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst Netherlands General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) - Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst Polish Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) - S\u0142u\u017cba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego Polish Foreign Intelligence Agency (AW) - Agencja Wywiadu Spain National Intelligence Centre (CNI) - Centro Nacional de Inteligencia The authoring agencies strongly urge network defenders to hunt for malicious activity and to apply the mitigations in this CSA to reduce the threat of Chinese state-sponsored and other malicious cyber activity. Any mitigation or eviction measures listed within are subject to change as new information becomes available and ongoing coordinated operations dictate. Network defenders should ensure any actions taken in response to the CSA are compliant with local laws and regulations within the jurisdictions within which they operate.",
      "risk_evaluation": "N/A",
      "vulnerability_overview": "N/A",
      "mitigations": "N/AThese APT actors are having considerable success using publicly known CVEs to gain access to networks, so organizations are strongly encouraged to prioritize patching in a way that is proportionate to this threat, such as by sequencing patches to address the highest risks first. See CISA\u2019sKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalogfor further information. Specifically, organizations should ensure edge devices are not vulnerable to known exploited CVEs identified in this advisory. Note: This advisory usesMITRE D3FEND\u2122, version 1.2.0, cybersecurity countermeasures. See theAppendix C: MITRE D3FEND Countermeasuressection of this advisory for a table of the mitigations mapped to MITRE D3FEND countermeasures."
