Maintain a trusted chain-of-custody on project files during creation, modification, distribution, backup, and use. Apply data-protection at the project level with a strong master password. For step-by-step configuration instructions, refer to \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Project Overview > Configuring Additional Project Settings > Options Tab > Data Protection. If passwords are being used as function parameters inside project documents (such as scripts or worksheets), it is recommended to remove those passwords and use project tags instead.

For more information see the associated Schneider Electric security advisory SEVD-2025-315-02 EcoStruxure Machine SCADA Expert & Pro-face BLUE Open Studio -PDF VersionThe CSAF version is availablehere. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices: Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks. Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode. Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device. Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information, refer to theSchneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practicesdocument.

      "mitigations": "N/AAVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation. Users using the affected product versions should take the following actions to mitigate the risk of exploit: Apply AVEVA Edge2023 R2 P01Security Update and migrate old project files. For projects that cannot be migrated (e.g. backups or transient copies), evaluate the risk of potential password leakage from these files and implement stricter read access controls to protect these unsafe files. Require AVEVA Edge users to change their passwords. Important: Edge project migration from older versions to 2023 R2 P01 is one-way due to the change in password hashing algorithms. The following general defensive measures are recommended: Access Control Lists should be applied to all folders where users will save and load project files. Maintain a trusted chain-of-custody on project files during creation, modification, distribution, and use. Apply data-protection at the project level with a strong master password. For configuration step-by-step refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Project Overview > Configuring Additional Project Settings > Options Tab > Data Protection. If passwords are being used as function parameters inside project documents (such as scripts or worksheets), it is recommended to remove those passwords and use project tags instead. For more information on tags refer to AVEVA Edge \"Technical Reference Manual\" > Tags and the Tag Database > About Tags and the Project Database. For information on how to reach AVEVA support for your product, please refer to this link:AVEVA Customer Support. For more information, see AVEVA's Security BulletinAVEVA-2025-006or AVEVA'sbulletins page. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.gov/icsin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages. Refer toRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scamsfor more information on avoiding email scams. Refer toAvoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacksfor more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely."

Users using affected product versions should apply security updates to mitigate the risk of exploit. All affected versions of the Application Server IDE can be fixed by upgrading to AVEVA System Platform2023 R2 SP1 P03or higher. The following general defensive measures are recommended: Audit assigned permissions to ensure that only trusted users are added to the \"aaConfigTools\" OS Group. For additional information on Application Server OS Security groups and accounts, seehttps://docs.aveva.com/bundle/sp-install/page/738031.html For more information, see AVEVA's Security BulletinAVEVA-2025-005or AVEVA'sbulletins page. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.
