Validate the integrity of the downloaded firmware by confirming its hash value. Access to the controller should remain limited to authorized personnel, and credentials must be protected and updated according to policy to reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications or the installation of tampered firmware Building X - Security Manager Edge Controller (ACC-AP): Currently no fix is planned As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according toSiemens' operational guidelines for industrial securityand following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on theSiemens industrial security webpage For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-420375 inHTMLandCSAF. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.govin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages. Refer toRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scamsfor more information on avoiding email scams. Refer toAvoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacksfor more information on social engineering attacks. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely."

Upgrade iSTAR Ultra G2, iSTAR Ultra G2 SE, iSTAR Edge G2 to version 6.9.3 or greater. For more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Johnson Controls Product Security AdvisoryJCI-PSA-2025-11 and JCI-PSA-2025-13. Johnson Controls recommends taking steps to minimize risks to all building automation systems in alignment with CISA's guidance. Further ICS security notices and product security guidance are located at Johnson Controls product securitywebsite. Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. For more information please contactJohnson Controls Global Product Securityor visit theirCybersecuritypage. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.
