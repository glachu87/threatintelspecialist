Contact Schneider Electric'sCustomer Care Centerfor assistance removing a patch. If users are unable to apply these patches, Schneider Electric recommends immediately applying the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploitation: Restrict access to BLMon by assigning permissions only to a limited set of user roles. Ensure users are assigned the least privileged role that still allows them to perform their designated tasks. Implement firewall rules to restrict SSH connections to the device. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices. Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks. Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode. Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device. Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information refer to the Schneider ElectricRecommended Cybersecurity Best Practicesdocument.

      "risk_evaluation": "N/ASuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or to cause a denial-of-service condition.",
      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are represented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y). CVE-2021-3712has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).",

      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AThe gmp plugin in strongSwan before version 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow vulnerability via a crafted certificate with an RSASSA-PSS signature. For example, this can be triggered by an unrelated self-signed CA certificate sent by an initiator. Remote code execution cannot occur. CVE-2021-41990has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before version 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow vulnerability upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
