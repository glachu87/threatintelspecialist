The remaining mitigations are general security measures that apply to all vulnerabilities: All vulnerabilities reported in the scope of this document are exploitable only if the attackers can access the network segment where ASPECT is installed and exposed directly to the Internet. ABB therefore recommends the following guidelines to protect customer networks:ASPECT devices should never be exposed directly to the Internet either via a direct ISP connection or via NAT port forwarding. If remote access to an ASPECT system is a user requirement, the system shall operate behind a firewall. Users accessing ASPECT remotely shall do this using a VPN Gateway allowing access to the network segment where ASPECT is installed and configured.Note: It is crucial that the VPN Gateway and Network are set up in accordance with best industry standards and maintained in terms of security patches for all related components.Authorized users shall change all default credentials during commissioning of an ASPECT system. If credentials have not been changed during commissioning state, ABB advises users to change each changeable credential at the earliest opportunity.Ensure that all ASPECT products are upgraded to the latest firmware version. The latest version of ASPECT firmware can be found on the respective product homepage.

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-9365. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).",
      "mitigations": "N/AFuji Electric recommends users update tov1.4.0.1 or later. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.
