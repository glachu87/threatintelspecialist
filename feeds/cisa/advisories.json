      "mitigations": "N/AJohnson Controls made firmware version 6.9.3 available in 2024 to fix CVE-2025-53695 and lower the risk of exploitation for CVE-2025-53696, CVE-2025-53697, and CVE-2025-53700. According to Johnson Controls, the iSTAR Ultra is an older device that has a planned end of service date within a year from this publication. Johnson Controls recommends users consider upgrading to a newer control unit. The hardware installation manual for iSTAR Ultra requires all control units be installed in a restricted access, protected area to lower the risk of physical tampering. For more detailed mitigation instructions, seeJohnson Controls Product Security Advisory. For assistance and additional information, contactJohnson Controls Trust Center. Dragos recommends end users place the following network restrictions around iSTAR controllers, regardless of model or firmware version: Pro Mode on iSTAR Ultra and iSTAR Ultra door controllers should be disabled. Use \"Ultra Mode.\" CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.gov/icsin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

      "mitigations": "N/ASchneider Electric will include fixes for these vulnerabilities as part of the next release of the product PME 2024 R3, planned for November 11, 2025. Until then, users are recommended to: Ensure PME is running in an isolated network. Deploy and configure the Windows firewall to limit access to appropriate network segments. Enforce complex password policies. Review Server Access Permissions Conduct an audit of all Windows-authenticated users who currently have access to PME. Repeat this audit of your system periodically. Identify all accounts with access rights, especially those with elevated privileges or remote access. Limit access to essential users only. Revoke access for any user accounts that are not critical for system functionality or daily operations. Apply the principle of least privilege to ensure users have only the access necessary for their role(s). Additionally, users should ensure the deployment of PME has followed thecybersecurity hardening guidelinesprovided with the product. For more information, see the associated Schneider Electric CPCERT security advisory, SEVD-2025-224-02 EcoStruxure Power Monitoring Expert (PME) -PDF Version,CSAF Version. Schneider Electric recommends the following general security practices: Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. Install physical controls to ensure that no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks. Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the \"Program\" mode. Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device. Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc., before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information refer to theSchneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.

This vulnerability may allow an attacker with access to a local network to intercept, manipulate, replay, or forge critical data, including read/write operations for voltage, current, and power configuration, operational status, alarms, telemetry, system reset, or inverter control commands, potentially disrupting power generation or reconfiguring inverter settings. CVE-2025-52586has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-52586. A base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). The affected product allows firmware updates to be downloaded from EG4's website, transferred via USB dongles, or installed through EG4's Monitoring Center (remote, cloud-connected interface) or via a serial connection, and can install these files without integrity checks. The TTComp archive format used for the firmware is unencrypted and can be unpacked and altered without detection. CVE-2025-53520has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-53520. A base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). The public-facing product registration endpoint server responds differently depending on whether the S/N is valid and unregistered, valid but already registered, or does not exist in the database. Combined with the fact that serial numbers are sequentially assigned, this allows an attacker to gain information on the product registration status of different S/Ns. CVE-2025-47872has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-47872. A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). The affected product does not limit the number of attempts for inputting the correct PIN for a registered product, which may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access using brute-force methods if they possess a valid device serial number. The API provides clear feedback when the correct PIN is entered. This vulnerability was patched in a server-side update on April 6, 2025. CVE-2025-46414has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-46414.

      "vulnerability_overview": "N/ATigo Energy's Cloud Connect Advanced (CCA) device contains hard-coded credentials that allow unauthorized users to gain administrative access. This vulnerability enables attackers to escalate privileges and take full control of the device, potentially modifying system settings, disrupting solar energy production, and interfering with safety mechanisms. CVE-2025-7768has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-7768. A base score of 9.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Tigo Energy's CCA is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability in the /cgi-bin/mobile_api endpoint when the DEVICE_PING command is called, allowing remote code execution due to improper handling of user input. When used with default credentials, this enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device that could cause potential unauthorized access, service disruption, and data exposure. CVE-2025-7769has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-7769. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Tigo Energy's CCA device is vulnerable to insecure session ID generation in their remote API. The session IDs are generated using a predictable method based on the current timestamp, allowing attackers to recreate valid session IDs. When combined with the ability to circumvent session ID requirements for certain commands, this enables unauthorized access to sensitive device functions on connected solar optimization systems. CVE-2025-7770has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-7770. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).",
      "mitigations": "N/ATigo Energy is aware of these vulnerabilities and is actively working on a fix to address them. Visit Tigo Energy'sHelp Centerfor more specific security recommendations. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.gov/icsin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
