      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AAn integer overflow can be triggered in SQLite's 'concat_ws()' function. The resulting, truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the original, untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size 4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution. CVE-2025-3277has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-3277.

In SQLite, the concat_ws() SQL function can cause memory to be written beyond the end of a malloc-allocated buffer. If the separator argument is attacker-controlled and has a large string (e.g., 2MB or more), an integer overflow occurs in calculating the size of the result buffer, and thus malloc may not allocate enough memory. CVE-2025-29087has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). A vulnerability in sqlite allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service via the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_LOOKASIDE component. CVE-2025-29088has been assigned to this vulnerability.

CVE-2021-44879has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: nf_tables: unregister flowtable hooks on netns exit. CVE-2022-48935has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). A use-after-free flaw was found in vcs_read in drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c in vc_screen in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow an attacker with local user access to cause a system crash or leak internal kernel information. CVE-2023-3567has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H). A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.cinnvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious local privileged user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation problem. CVE-2023-5178has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate an X9.42 DH key and DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. If the keys or parameters being checked are obtained from an untrusted source, this may lead to a denial of service (DoS). While DH_check() performs all necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() does not perform these checks, making it vulnerable to excessively large P and Q parameters. Similarly, while DH_generate_key() checks for an excessively large P, it does not check for an excessively large Q. An application calling DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial of service attack. DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also invoked by several other OpenSSL functions. Applications using these functions may similarly be affected. Other affected functions include DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate(). The OpenSSL pkey command line application (when using the \"-pubcheck\" option) and the OpenSSL genpkey command line application are also vulnerable. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation and the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue. CVE-2023-5678has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer. It is recommended to upgrade past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06. CVE-2023-5717has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). An out-of-bounds access vulnerability involving netfilter was reported and fixed in commit f1082dd31fe4 (netfilter: nf_tables: Reject tables of unsupported family). While creating a new netfilter table, the lack of a safeguard against invalid nf_tables family (pf) values within the nf_tables_newtable function allows an attacker to achieve out-of-bounds access. CVE-2023-6040has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a remote attacker to send a crafted TCP packet, triggering a heap-based buffer overflow that results in kmalloc data being printed and potentially leaked to the kernel ring buffer (dmesg). CVE-2023-6121has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smbCalcSize in fs/smb/client/netmisc.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information. CVE-2023-6606has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H). A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. A perf_event's read_size can overflow, leading to an heap out-of-bounds increment or write in perf_read_group(). It is recommended to upgrade past commit 382c27f4ed28f803b1f1473ac2d8db0afc795a1b. CVE-2023-6931has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ipv4: igmp component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. A race condition can be exploited to cause a timer be mistakenly registered on a RCU read locked object, which is freed by another thread. It is recommended to upgrade past commit e2b706c691905fe78468c361aaabc719d0a496f1. CVE-2023-6932has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.3.8. A use-after-free was found in ravb_remove in drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/ravb_main.c. CVE-2023-35827has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation. CVE-2023-39198has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

      "risk_evaluation": "N/ASuccessful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read memory contents, to change the application behavior, or to create a denial-of-service condition.",
      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AIn order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behavior or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. CVE-2021-3711has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are represented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y). CVE-2021-3712has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H). The BN_mod_sqrt() function in openSSL, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. CVE-2022-0778has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2022-0778. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. CVE-2023-0286has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H). A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the -policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() function. CVE-2023-0464has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).",

When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure HTTP:// scheme and perform transfers with hosts like \u00a0x.example.com as well as example.com \u00a0where the first host is a subdomain of the second host (the HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem). When x.example.com responds with x.example.com Strict-Transport-Security: headers, this bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeoutbleed overand get set for the parent domain example.com in curl's HSTS cache. The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to example.com get converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If example.com for instance stops supporting HTTPS at its expiry time, curl might then fail to access example.com until the (wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entryearlier, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. CVE-2024-9681has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the folio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely determine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system. In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop with I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing the log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot. Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page. CVE-2024-39469has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). bcache: Variable length array abuse in btree_iter.

CVE-2024-39501has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). ionic: use after netif_napi_del(). When queues are started, netif_napi_add() and napi_enable() are called. If there are 4 queues and only 3 queues are used for the current configuration, only 3 queues' napi should be registered and enabled. The ionic_qcq_enable() checks whether the .poll pointer is not NULL for enabling only the using queue' napi. Unused queues' napi will not be registered by netif_napi_add(), so the .poll pointer indicates NULL. But it couldn't distinguish whether the napi was unregistered or not because netif_napi_del() doesn't reset the .poll pointer to NULL. So, ionic_qcq_enable() calls napi_enable() for the queue, which was unregistered by netif_napi_del(). CVE-2024-39502has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In the good case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits a warning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which triggers the 'scheduling in atomic' warning. Unlock rt_mutex::wait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning and dropping into the schedule for ever loop. CVE-2024-46829has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which may be problematic because there is no lock on the extent leave, potentially leading to a transient incorrect answer. In walk_down_proc, BUG_ON(refs == 0) is also used, which could occur due to extent tree corruption. This has been changed to return -EUCLEAN. In do_walk_down() this case is caught and handled correctly, however -EIO is returned, whereas -EUCLEAN would a more appropriate error code. Finally in walk_up_proc, BUG_ON(refs == 0) is also used, it has also been converted to proper error handling. CVE-2024-46840has been assigned to this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-47659has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fsnotify: clear PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily In some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries. Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a significant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens under inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock when we remove the watch from the directory as the __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask() races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from __fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup reports reported by users. Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to set PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children. When parent stops watching children, clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED flags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child. CVE-2024-47660has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). staging: iio: frequency: ad9834: In ad9834_write_frequency() clk_get_rate() can return 0.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()Patch series \"nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes\".This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently discovered by syzbot. This patch (of 3):If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than 2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(), which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to detect this inconsistency.Thanks to Lizhi Xu for trying to solve the bug and clarifying the cause early on.

A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:block: fix potential invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partitionThe blk_add_partition() function initially used a single if-condition (IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This was modified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the function to proceed without logging the error in this case. However, this change unintentionally left a path where md_autodetect_dev() could be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.This commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the initial if-condition, improving code readability and handling specific error scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes the general error case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of md_autodetect_dev() calls. CVE-2024-47705has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (\"aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts\") makes tx() calling dev_put() instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs into use-after-free. Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the refcnt of skb->dev. On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue. CVE-2024-49982has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: ethernet: lantiq_etop: fix memory disclosure When applying padding, the buffer is not zeroed, which results in memory disclosure. The mentioned data is observed on the wire. This patch uses skb_put_padto() to pad Ethernet frames properly. The mentioned function zeroes the expanded buffer. In case the packet cannot be padded it is silently dropped. Statistics are also not incremented. This driver does not support statistics in the old 32-bit format or the new 64-bit format. These will be added in the future. In its current form, the patch should be easily backported to stable versions. Ethernet MACs on Amazon-SE and Danube cannot do padding of the packets in hardware, so software padding must be applied. CVE-2024-49997has been assigned to this vulnerability.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5: Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmitRemove the erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was establishedThe multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping for the skb. This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMU driver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the code tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously unmaps one entry from the sq's FIFO list of active mappings. Since the current map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping that might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA, the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI function in error state.The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created memory pressure.
