These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019sCPGs webpagefor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. Upgrade VMware vSphere serversto the latest version [CPG 1.E]. Harden your VMware vSphere environmentsby applyingVMware\u2019s guidance. For additional guidance on logging [CPG 2.T] and hardening, seeFrom Help Desk to Hypervisor: Defending Your VMware vSphere Estate from UNC3944. Take inventory of all network edge devices [CPG 1.A] and monitorfor any suspicious network connectivity originating from these devices. Ensure proper network segmentation restricts network traffic from the DMZ to the internal network [CPG 2.F]. Disable RDP and SMBfrom the DMZ to the internal network. Apply the principle of least privilege and restrict service accountsto only needed permissions. Increase monitoring for service accounts,which are highly privileged and have a predictable pattern of behavior (e.g., scans that reliably run at a certain hour of the day). Block unauthorized DoH providers and external DoH network trafficto reduce unmonitored communications."

CVE-2025-64642has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-64642. A base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous version installations where the embedded Microsoft SQLServer Express is used are exposed in the Windows share accessed by clients in networked installs. By default, this directory has insecure directory paths that allow access to the SQL Server database and configuration files, which can contain sensitive data. CVE-2025-64298has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-64298. A base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a common SQL Server user account to access data in the database. User access in the client application is restricted by a password authentication check in the client software but the underlying database connection always has access. The latest version of NMIS/BioDose introduces an option to use Windows user authentication with the database, which would restrict this database connection. CVE-2025-61940has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-61940. A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). NMIS/BioDose software V22.02 and previous versions contain executable binaries with plain text hard-coded passwords. These hard-coded passwords could allow unauthorized access to both the application and database. CVE-2025-64778has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2025-64778. A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a Microsoft SQL Server database. The SQL user account 'nmdbuser' and other created accounts by default have the sysadmin role. This can lead to remote code execution through the use of certain built-in stored procedures. CVE-2025-62575has been assigned to this vulnerability.
