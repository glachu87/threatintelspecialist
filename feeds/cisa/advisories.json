The issue is triggered during parsing of a malformed DICOM file containing encapsulated PixelData fragments (compressed image data stored as multiple fragments). This vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault caused by an out-of-bounds memory access due to unsigned integer underflow in buffer indexing. It is exploitable via file input, simply opening a crafted malicious DICOM file is sufficient to trigger the crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.gov/icsin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.

The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA\u2019sCPGs webpagefor more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. Upgrade VMware vSphere serversto the latest version [CPG 1.E]. Harden your VMware vSphere environmentsby applyingVMware\u2019s guidance. For additional guidance on logging [CPG 2.T] and hardening, seeFrom Help Desk to Hypervisor: Defending Your VMware vSphere Estate from UNC3944. Take inventory of all network edge devices [CPG 1.A] and monitorfor any suspicious network connectivity originating from these devices. Ensure proper network segmentation restricts network traffic from the DMZ to the internal network [CPG 2.F]. Disable RDP and SMBfrom the DMZ to the internal network. Apply the principle of least privilege and restrict service accountsto only needed permissions. Increase monitoring for service accounts,which are highly privileged and have a predictable pattern of behavior (e.g., scans that reliably run at a certain hour of the day). Block unauthorized DoH providers and external DoH network trafficto reduce unmonitored communications."
