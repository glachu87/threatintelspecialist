      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are represented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y). CVE-2021-3712has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).",

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on theSiemens industrial security webpage. For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-244969 inHTMLandCSAF. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.govin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.

      "risk_evaluation": "N/ASuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition.",
      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AThe BN_mod_sqrt() function in openSSL, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. CVE-2022-0778has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).",

      "vulnerability_overview": "N/AThe gmp plugin in strongSwan before version 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow vulnerability via a crafted certificate with an RSASSA-PSS signature. For example, this can be triggered by an unrelated self-signed CA certificate sent by an initiator. Remote code execution cannot occur. CVE-2021-41990has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before version 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow vulnerability upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

All affected products: In non-networked scenarios/deployments, block TCP ports 4002 and 4004 on machines with UMC installed. If the deployment is not using the 'RT Server' type of UMC machine, port 4004 can be blocked everywhere without impacting network functionality for all other UMC machine-types (Server, Ring-Server, Agent). SIMATIC PCS neo V4.1, SIMATIC PCS neo V5.0: No fix is currently planned. As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according toSiemens' operational guidelines for industrial securityand following recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on theSiemens industrial security webpage. For more information, see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-722410 inHTMLandCSAF. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section forcontrol systems security recommended practiceson the ICS webpage oncisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, includingImproving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies forproactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage atcisa.govin the technical information paper,ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time."

The remaining mitigations are general security measures that apply to all vulnerabilities: All vulnerabilities reported in the scope of this document are exploitable only if the attackers can access the network segment where ASPECT is installed and exposed directly to the Internet. ABB therefore recommends the following guidelines to protect customer networks:ASPECT devices should never be exposed directly to the Internet either via a direct ISP connection or via NAT port forwarding. If remote access to an ASPECT system is a user requirement, the system shall operate behind a firewall. Users accessing ASPECT remotely shall do this using a VPN Gateway allowing access to the network segment where ASPECT is installed and configured.Note: It is crucial that the VPN Gateway and Network are set up in accordance with best industry standards and maintained in terms of security patches for all related components.Authorized users shall change all default credentials during commissioning of an ASPECT system. If credentials have not been changed during commissioning state, ABB advises users to change each changeable credential at the earliest opportunity.Ensure that all ASPECT products are upgraded to the latest firmware version. The latest version of ASPECT firmware can be found on the respective product homepage.
