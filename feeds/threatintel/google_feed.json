Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a novel backdoor tracked as GRIMBOLT. The initial access vector for these incidents was not confirmed, but UNC6201 is known to target edge appliances (such as VPN concentrators) for initial access. There are notable overlaps between UNC6201 and UNC5221, which has been used synonymously with the actor publicly reported as Silk Typhoon, although GTIG does not currently consider the two clusters to"

This investigation revealed a tailored intrusion resulting in the deployment of seven unique malware families, including a new set of tooling designed to capture host and victim data: SILENCELIFT, DEEPBREATH and CHROMEPUSH.
