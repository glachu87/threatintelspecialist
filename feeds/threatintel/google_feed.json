      "description": "Introduction \nMandiant has identified an expansion in threat activity that uses tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent with prior ShinyHunters-branded extortion operations. These operations primarily leverage sophisticated voice phishing (vishing) and victim-branded credential harvesting sites to gain initial access to corporate environments by obtaining single sign-on (SSO) credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes. Once inside, the threat actors target cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to exfiltrate sensitive data and internal communications for use in subsequent extortion demands.\nGoogle Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) is currently tracking this activity under multiple threat clusters (UNC6661, UNC6671, and UNC6240) to enable a more granular understanding of evolving partnerships and account for potential impersonation activity.

As detailed in our companion report, 'Vishing for Access: Tracking the Expansion of ShinyHunters-Branded SaaS Data Theft', these campaigns leverage evolved voice phishing (vishing) and victim-branded credential harvesting to successfully compromise single sign-on (SSO) credentials and enroll unauthorized devices into victim multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions.\nThis activity is not the result of a security vulnerability in vendors' products or infrastructure. Instead, these intrusions rely on the effectiveness of social engineering to bypass identity controls and pivot into cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) environments.\nThis post provides actionable hardening, logging, and detection recommendations to help organizations protect against these threats.

Despite Net-NTLMv1 being deprecated and known to be insecure for over two decades—with cryptanalysis dating back to 1999—Mandiant consultants continue to identify its use in active environments. This legacy protocol leaves organizations vulnerable to trivial credential theft, yet it remains prevalent due to inertia and a lack of demonstrated immediate risk.\nBy releasing these tables, Mandiant aims to lower the barrier for security professionals to demonstrate the insecurity of Net-NTLMv1. While tools to exploit this protocol have existed for years, they often required uploading sensitive data to third-party services or expensive hardware to brute-force keys.

Leveraging TTD's powerful data model and time travel capabilities allow us to efficiently pivot to the key execution events that lead to the final payload.\nThis post introduces all of the basics of WinDbg and TTD necessary to start incorporating TTD into your analysis.
